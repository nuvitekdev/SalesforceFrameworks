### Code Quality Enhancements
1. **ESLint Configuration**: Fixed decorator parsing issues for LWC components
2. **Prettier Formatting**: Consistent code formatting across 62 files
3. **Jest Test Validation**: Confirmed working test framework
4. **Naming Consistency**: Standardized component and file naming

### Documentation Standards
1. **Comprehensive READMEs**: Every major component has detailed documentation
2. **Architecture Documentation**: Enterprise-level architectural overview
3. **Component Inventory**: Complete dependency mapping and technical specs
4. **Usage Examples**: Clear installation and configuration instructions

### Security & Compliance

3. **API Security**: Secure external integrations with encrypted credentials
4. **Permission Management**: Proper permission sets and profiles structure

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas Identified for Future Improvement

### High Priority
1. **Missing Apex Test Classes**: 6+ utility components need test coverage
   - PDF Creator Drag & Drop
   - Natural Language SOQL  
   - Messaging Platform
   - License Visualizer
   - Interview Recorder
   - Dynamic List Viewer

2. **Jest Test Coverage**: Most LWC components need unit tests
   - Only 2 components currently have Jest tests
   - Should add comprehensive test suites for all LWC components

### Medium Priority  
1. **Component READMEs**: Some utility components need enhanced documentation
   - NuviMessaging lacks README
   - Hero Banner needs usage documentation
   
2. **Error Handling**: Standardize error handling patterns across components

3. **Performance Optimization**: Review governor limit usage in complex components

### Low Priority
1. **Code Refactoring**: Some Aura components could be modernized to LWC
2. **Integration Testing**: Cross-component integration test suites
3. **Monitoring Enhancement**: Performance tracking for complex workflows
