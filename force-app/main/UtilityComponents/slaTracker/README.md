## What is the SLA Tracker?

The SLA Tracker is a dynamic, configurable Lightning Web Component (LWC) that provides real-time monitoring of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) directly within Salesforce record pages. It offers visual tracking of response times against configurable targets, allowing teams to stay on top of their service commitments.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Configuration**: Configure SLA duration, tracking fields, and status values through the component's properties without requiring custom metadata.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live countdown display with automatic updates when SLA status changes.
- **Visual Progress Indicator**: Color-coded progress bar changes from green to yellow to red as the deadline approaches.
- **Multiple Status Support**: Tracks various statuses including Active, Paused, Met, and Breached.
- **Business Hours Integration**: Optional support for calculating SLAs based on business hours.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean, Apple-inspired design with responsive layout for all devices.
- **Flow Integration**: Can be used in Flow screens with output variables for SLA status.

## Why Use the SLA Tracker?

Organizations invest significant resources in establishing SLAs to ensure timely service delivery and response. The SLA Tracker component offers several benefits:
