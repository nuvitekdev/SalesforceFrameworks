This helps users understand the purpose of the assistant. Examples: 'AI Assistant', 'Sales Helper', 'HR Document Analyzer', 'Compliance Checker'. Default: 'AI Assistant'"/>
            <property name="primaryColor" type="String" default="#22BDC1" label="Primary Color" description="SETUP: The main color for the component's UI elements like buttons and headers. Use hex color format (#RRGGBB). This should match your org's branding. Example: '#1589EE' for Salesforce blue, '#22BDC1' for Nuvitek teal. Use online hex color pickers to find the right color. Default: '#22BDC1'"/>

To find this: Setup > Custom Metadata Types > LLM Configuration > Manage Records. Copy the exact DeveloperName (e.g., 'GPT_4_Turbo', 'Claude_3_Sonnet'). Leave empty to let users choose their own model. This is useful when you want to standardize which AI model your team uses."/>
            <property name="hideModelSelector" type="Boolean" default="false" label="Hide Model Selector" description="SETUP: Check this box to hide the AI model dropdown from users. Use this when: 1) You've set a default model and don't want users to change it, 2) You want a simpler interface, 3) Your org has standardized on one AI provider. If unchecked, users can switch between different AI models. Default: unchecked (false)"/>
            <property name="contextPrompt" type="String" label="Assistant Context" description="SETUP: Provide context to make the AI assistant more helpful for your specific use case. This text is sent with every request to guide the AI's responses. Examples: 'You are helping sales reps on opportunity records. Focus on deal closing strategies and competitor analysis.' or 'You are an HR assistant helping review resumes. Focus on matching skills to job requirements.' or 'You are on a case record page. Help agents resolve customer issues quickly.' Leave empty for general-purpose assistance."/>
            <property name="enableAnomalyDetection" type="Boolean" default="false" label="Enable Anomaly Detection" description="SETUP: Check this box to automatically scan records for unusual patterns when the component loads. The AI will analyze the record and display a yellow banner if it finds: missing required data, unusual field combinations, data inconsistencies, suspicious patterns, or outdated information. Great for: quality control, data validation, fraud detection, error prevention. Example: On an Opportunity, it might detect 'Close date is tomorrow but last activity was 6 months ago'. Default: unchecked (false)"/>
            <property name="enableImageValidation" type="Boolean" default="false" label="Enable Image Analysis" description="SETUP: Check this box to allow users to analyze image files (JPG, PNG, GIF) attached to records. When enabled, an 'Analyze Images' button appears that can: extract text from images (OCR), analyze business cards for contact info, read receipts and invoices, understand diagrams and charts, verify ID documents. Requires: OpenAI with Vision API access. Use cases: HR scanning IDs, Finance processing receipts, Sales capturing business cards. Default: unchecked (false)"/>
            <property name="enableDocumentAnalysis" type="Boolean" default="false" label="Enable Document Analysis" description="SETUP: Check this box to enable PDF document analysis. When enabled, an 'Analyze Documents' button appears that can: extract text and data from PDFs, map extracted data to Salesforce fields, analyze contracts and agreements, process forms and applications. Works with 'Document Data Extraction Fields' setting. Example: Upload a signed contract PDF and extract the contract number, date, and amount. Max 3 PDFs at once for best performance. Default: unchecked (false)"/>
            <property name="enableComparison" type="Boolean" default="false" label="Enable Comparison" description="SETUP: Check this box to compare content against standards or requirements. Two modes: 1) MANUAL - If 'Compare From' is empty, shows a 'Compare to Standards' button for users to input content. 2) AUTOMATIC - If 'Compare From' has content, runs comparison immediately when component loads. Use cases: HR comparing resumes to job requirements, Procurement evaluating vendor proposals, Compliance checking documents against regulations. Must set 'Comparison Rules' for this to work. Default: unchecked (false)"/>
            <property name="comparisonRules" type="String" default="" label="Comparison Rules (TO)" description="SETUP: Define the standards/criteria to compare content against. Two formats: 1) JSON FORMAT for complex criteria: {'position':'Senior Dev','requirements':{'experience':'5+ years','skills':['Apex','LWC']}}. 2) TEXT FORMAT for simple rules: 'Must have 5 years experience\nBachelor degree required\nSalesforce certified'. The AI compares content against these rules and provides detailed analysis. Examples in README. TIP: Test with a simple text list first, then move to JSON for complex evaluations. Required when 'Enable Comparison' is checked."/>
            <property name="compareFrom" type="String" default="" label="Compare From (Source)" description="SETUP: Optional - The content to automatically compare against your rules. Three scenarios: 1) LEAVE EMPTY on a record page - automatically uses the current record's data for comparison. 2) LEAVE EMPTY on other pages - users click 'Compare to Standards' and paste content manually. 3) PROVIDE CONTENT for automatic comparison - set via Flow or formula field, comparison runs immediately. Example: In a Flow, set this to {!Resume_Text} variable. Or use a formula to pull in application text. When provided, results appear in a banner without user interaction. Perfect for automated screening workflows."/>
            <property name="relatedObjects" type="String" default="" label="Related Objects" description="SETUP: List the child objects to include when analyzing records. Format: Comma-separated API names without spaces. Example: 'Contact,Opportunity,Case,Task,Event'. The AI will analyze these related records for deeper insights. Tips: 1) Only include objects users have access to, 2) Start with 2-3 objects and add more if needed, 3) More objects = slower analysis. Common combos: Account page: 'Contact,Opportunity,Case'. Contact page: 'Case,Task,Event'. Leave empty to only analyze the main record."/>
            <property name="analysisFieldApiName" type="String" default="" label="Analysis Field API Name" description="SETUP: Enter the API name of a text field where AI analysis can be saved. Steps: 1) Create a Long Text Area field on your object (min 600 chars), 2) Copy the API name (e.g., 'AI_Analysis_Summary__c'), 3) Enter it here. When users click 'Analyze Record', they can save a summary to this field. The AI automatically creates a concise summary under 600 characters. Example fields: 'Deal_Analysis__c' on Opportunity, 'Account_Summary__c' on Account. Leave empty to disable saving."/>
            <property name="documentAnalysisFieldsApiNames" type="String" default="" label="Document Data Extraction Fields" description="SETUP: List fields to populate from document analysis. Format: Comma-separated API names. Example: 'Contract_Number__c,Contract_Date__c,Total_Amount__c,Vendor_Name__c'. When a user analyzes a PDF, the AI extracts data and suggests updating these fields. Process: 1) User uploads PDF, 2) Clicks 'Analyze Documents', 3) AI extracts matching data, 4) Shows suggestions in modal, 5) User approves updates. Common uses: Invoice processing, contract management, form automation. TIP: Start with 3-5 key fields. Make sure field types match expected data (date fields for dates, etc.)."/>
