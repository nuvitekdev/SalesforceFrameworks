## What is the PDF Signer?

The PDF Signer is a powerful Lightning Web Component (LWC) that enables electronic document signing directly within Salesforce. Users can upload PDF documents, review them, add their signatures (either drawn or typed), and place these signatures precisely on the document. The component automatically saves signed documents as Salesforce files associated with the specified record.

### Key Features

- **Multiple Signature Methods**: Draw signatures using a signature pad or create typed signatures with elegant fonts.
- **Precise Signature Placement**: Drag, resize, and position signatures exactly where needed on any page of the PDF.
- **Multi-Page Support**: Navigate through document pages and add signatures to any page.
- **PDF Preview**: Built-in PDF viewer with zoom and navigation controls.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean, Apple-inspired design with responsive layout for all devices.
- **Customizable Theming**: Configure primary and accent colors to match your Salesforce theme.
- **Record Association**: Automatically associate signed documents with Salesforce records.
- **Flow Integration**: Can be used in Flow screens with output variables for the generated file.

Electronic signatures have become essential for business processes, and the PDF Signer component offers several benefits:

1. **Efficiency**: Eliminate printing, signing, scanning, and uploading steps in signature workflows.
2. **Cost Reduction**: Save on paper, printing, and storage costs associated with physical signatures.
3. **Improved Experience**: Provide a seamless, in-platform signing experience for users.
