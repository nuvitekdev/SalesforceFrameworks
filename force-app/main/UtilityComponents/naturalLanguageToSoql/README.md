## Component Configuration

The following attributes can be configured in the Lightning App Builder:

| Attribute                | Description                                              | Default              | Enhanced Features        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Object API Names**     | Comma-separated API names of Salesforce objects to query | `Account`            | âœ… Multi-object support  |
| **LLM Config Name**      | Developer Name of the LLM Configuration metadata record  | `OpenAI_GPT4_1_Mini` | âœ… Multiple AI providers |
| **Primary Color**        | Primary color for the component theme                    | `#22BDC1`            | âœ… Dynamic theming       |
| **Accent Color**         | Accent color for the component theme                     | `#D5DF23`            | âœ… Dynamic theming       |
| **Record Limit**         | Maximum number of records to return                      | `50`                 | âœ… Smart caching         |
| **Enable Query History** | Save recent queries in browser storage                   | `false`              | âœ… Enhanced tracking     |

## ðŸ’¡ Usage Examples

The enhanced component supports a variety of natural language query patterns with improved understanding:

### Simple Queries

- "Show me recent customers" â†’ `SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE CreatedDate = LAST_N_DAYS:30`
- "Find open deals" â†’ `SELECT Id, Name, Amount FROM Opportunity WHERE IsClosed = false`
- "List high priority tickets" â†’ `SELECT Id, Subject, Priority FROM Case WHERE Priority = 'High'`

### Advanced Queries with Synonyms

- "Show big revenue opportunities this quarter" â†’ Auto-translates "revenue" to "Amount"
- "Find customers in California" â†’ Auto-translates "customers" to "Account"
- "Get sales reps with most deals" â†’ Understands "sales reps" as "Owner"

### Cross-Object Queries

- "Show accounts with their primary contacts"
- "Find opportunities with related account information"
- "List cases with account details"

### Time-Based Queries with Pattern Recognition

- "Show newest 10 accounts" â†’ Automatically adds `ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC LIMIT 10`
- "Find records created this month" â†’ Uses `THIS_MONTH` date literal
- "Top 5 biggest opportunities" â†’ Orders by Amount DESC with LIMIT 5

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

The enhanced component uses advanced AI and intelligent processing to convert natural language to SOQL:

### 1. **Query Enhancement Pipeline**

```
User Input â†’ Synonym Mapping â†’ Pattern Recognition â†’ LLM Processing â†’ SOQL Generation
```

### 2. **Multi-Layer Processing**

1. **Synonym Translation**: Converts business terms to Salesforce field names
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies common query patterns (top N, newest, etc.)
3. **Dynamic Metadata Discovery**: Retrieves accessible object fields and relationships
4. **LLM Integration**: Uses configured AI models for complex natural language understanding
5. **Query Optimization**: Applies caching and validation for performance
6. **Smart Retry Logic**: Automatic error correction with fallback mechanisms

### 3. **Advanced Understanding**

The component can intelligently interpret:

#### Business Language

- **Synonyms**: customer/client â†’ Account, deal/sale â†’ Opportunity, ticket/issue â†’ Case
- **Context**: Understands "revenue" means Amount field, "rep" means Owner
- **Relationships**: Knows how to join related objects (Account.Name in Contact queries)

#### Query Patterns

- **Sorting**: "newest", "biggest", "top N" â†’ Automatic ORDER BY clauses
- **Filtering**: "open", "closed", "active" â†’ Smart WHERE conditions
- **Time References**: "this month", "last quarter", "today" â†’ Date literals
- **Aggregations**: "count", "sum", "average" â†’ GROUP BY queries

#### Performance Features

- **Intelligent Caching**: 5-minute cache for identical queries
- **Debounced Suggestions**: Real-time auto-complete with 300ms debounce
- **Field-Level Security**: Automatic permission checking
- **Error Recovery**: Fallback patterns when AI fails

## Security Considerations

- The component respects object and field-level security (FLS)
- Queries are constructed with built-in protection against SOQL injection
- The component only accesses fields the current user has permission to view
- Rate limiting is applied to prevent performance issues

## ðŸ¤– AI Integration & Extension

The component supports multiple AI providers and can be extended for specific use cases:

### Supported LLM Providers

- **OpenAI**: GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo models
- **Anthropic**: Claude models
- **Google**: Gemini models
- **DeepSeek**: DeepSeek models
- **OpenRouter**: Access to multiple models

### Configuration Options

```apex
// Example LLM Configuration Custom Metadata
LLM_Configuration__mdt config = new LLM_Configuration__mdt(
    DeveloperName = 'OpenAI_GPT4_Enhanced',
    Provider__c = 'OpenAI',
    Model_Name__c = 'gpt-4-turbo',
    Base_URL__c = 'https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions',
    Temperature__c = 0.1,
    Max_Tokens__c = 1000
);
```

### Custom Extensions

1. **Industry-Specific Synonyms**: Add domain-specific term mappings
2. **Custom Query Patterns**: Define organization-specific query templates
3. **Advanced Caching Strategies**: Implement custom cache partitions
4. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Add business logic for specific error scenarios

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting & Performance Tips

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Query Not Working as Expected

1. **Check Enhanced Query**: Look for the "Query enhanced" message to see how synonyms were applied
2. **Try Alternative Phrasing**: Use business terms (customer, deal, ticket) for better recognition
3. **Use Query Suggestions**: Start typing and select from auto-complete suggestions
4. **Review Cache**: Clear browser cache if you're testing configuration changes

#### Performance Optimization

1. **Cache Hit Rate**: Monitor debug logs for cache usage
2. **LLM Response Time**: Consider switching to faster models for real-time use
3. **Field Metadata**: Large objects may take longer for initial metadata loading
4. **Suggestion Debouncing**: 300ms debounce prevents excessive API calls

#### Security & Permissions

1. **Object Access**: Ensure user has read access to configured objects
2. **Field-Level Security**: Component automatically respects FLS settings
3. **LLM Configuration**: Verify LLM_Configuration\_\_mdt records are accessible
4. **Cache Permissions**: Platform Cache requires proper org setup

### Debug Information

Enable debug logs for detailed processing information:

```apex
// In Developer Console
System.debug('Natural Language Query processed successfully.');
System.debug('Result cached with key: ' + cacheKey);
System.debug('Enhanced query: ' + enhancedQuery);
```
