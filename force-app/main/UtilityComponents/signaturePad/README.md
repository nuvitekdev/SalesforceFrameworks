## What is the Signature Capture?

The Signature Capture is a lightweight, versatile Lightning Web Component (LWC) that enables capturing electronic signatures directly within Salesforce. The component offers both handwritten (drawing) and typed signature options with a clean, elegant interface. Captured signatures are saved as image files that can be stored as Salesforce Files and associated with records.

### Key Features

- **Dual Signature Methods**: Draw signatures with a natural pen-like experience or create typed signatures with elegant fonts.
- **Customizable Appearance**: Configure colors, sizes, and fonts to match your Salesforce theme.
- **Responsive Canvas**: Adapts to different screen sizes for consistent user experience across devices.
- **Real-time Preview**: See the signature as it's being created.
- **Record Association**: Automatically attach signatures to any Salesforce record.
- **Flow Integration**: Designed for seamless integration with Flow screens, with output variables for the saved signature URL.
- **Lightweight Design**: Focused on one task, making it easy to embed anywhere.
- **Accessibility Support**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.

## Why Use the Signature Capture?

Capturing signatures is essential for many business processes, and this component offers significant advantages:

1. **Simplicity**: Purpose-built for signature capture, without the complexity of full document signing.
2. **Integration**: Seamlessly embed in any Salesforce page without external tools.
3. **Flexibility**: The versatile design works for quick acknowledgments, approvals, or form completions.
4. **Improved Experience**: Provide an intuitive, in-platform signing experience.
5. **Process Acceleration**: Eliminate the need for printing forms just to capture signatures.
6. **Consistency**: Maintain a uniform signature capture process across all use cases.
7. **Reusability**: The modular design makes it easy to implement in multiple contexts.
