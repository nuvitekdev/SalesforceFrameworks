# Applications Module

## Overview

Core application processing module for Nuvi permit and licensing system. Handles intake, validation, and management of various permit types including APD (Application for Permit to Drill), mining permits, recreation permits, and general land use permits.

## Purpose

Facilitates the complete application lifecycle from initial submission through approval or denial, including:
- Dynamic form generation based on permit type
- Document collection and validation
- Application status tracking
- Fee calculation and integration
- Compliance checking

## Key Components

### Custom Objects
- `DOI_PAL_Application__c` - Master application record
- `DOI_PAL_Application_Document__c` - Required documents tracking
- `DOI_PAL_Application_Review__c` - Review stage tracking
- `DOI_PAL_Fee_Structure__c` - Dynamic fee calculation

### Apex Classes
- `DOI_PAL_ApplicationController` - Main application management
- `DOI_PAL_ApplicationService` - Business logic layer
- `DOI_PAL_ApplicationValidator` - Validation rules engine
- `DOI_PAL_FeeCalculationService` - Fee computation logic

### Lightning Web Components
- `doiPalApplicationForm` - Dynamic application form
- `doiPalApplicationStatus` - Status tracking component
- `doiPalDocumentUpload` - File upload interface
- `doiPalFeeCalculator` - Real-time fee display

## Application Types

### 1. APD (Application for Permit to Drill)
- **Standard Fee**: $12,515 per application
- **Review Process**: Multi-stage with BLM, environmental, and legal reviews
- **Documents Required**: Drilling plan, environmental assessment, bond documentation
- **Timeline**: 30-60 days standard processing

### 2. General Land Use Permits
- **Variable Fees**: Based on acreage and use type
- **Review Process**: Streamlined for low-impact uses
- **Documents Required**: Site plan, environmental checklist
- **Timeline**: 15-30 days standard processing

### 3. Mining Permits
- **Fee Structure**: Tiered based on operation scale
- **Review Process**: Enhanced environmental review
- **Documents Required**: Mining plan, reclamation bond, water quality permits
- **Timeline**: 60-90 days with NEPA compliance

### 4. Recreation Permits
- **Fee Structure**: Based on visitor capacity and duration
- **Review Process**: Coordinated with NPS and local authorities
- **Documents Required**: Operating plan, insurance documentation
- **Timeline**: 30-45 days standard processing

## Best Practices

### Development Standards
- Use bulkified patterns for all DML operations
- Implement comprehensive validation at both UI and server levels
- Follow naming convention: `DOI_PAL_Application_[Function]`
- Include proper error handling with user-friendly messages

### Security Implementation
- Enforce field-level security on all sensitive data
- Use WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED in all SOQL queries
- Validate file uploads for security threats
- Implement audit trail for all application changes

### Performance Optimization
- Use selective queries with indexed fields
- Implement pagination for large dataset views
- Cache frequently accessed fee structures
- Optimize file upload processes for large documents

## Integration Points

- **Payment Processing**: Integration with `payments/` module
- **Document Management**: Connection to `documents/` module
- **Workflow Engine**: Triggers processes in `workflows/` module
- **GIS Validation**: Location checks via `gis-mapping/` module
- **AI Services**: Document analysis through `ai-services/` module

## Usage Examples

### Creating New Application
```apex
DOI_PAL_Application__c newApp = new DOI_PAL_Application__c(
    Application_Type__c = 'APD',
    Applicant_Name__c = 'Example Operator LLC',
    Location_Description__c = 'Section 16, Township 2N, Range 68W',
    Status__c = 'Submitted'
);

DOI_PAL_ApplicationService.createApplication(newApp);
```

### Fee Calculation
```javascript
import { calculateFees } from 'c/doiPalFeeCalculator';

const fees = await calculateFees({
    applicationType: 'APD',
    acreage: 640,
    duration: 24
});
```

## Testing Requirements

- Minimum 85% test coverage for all Apex classes
- Jest tests for all Lightning Web Components
- Integration tests for workflow triggers
- Performance testing for large dataset operations

## Compliance Notes

- All applications must maintain complete audit trail
- Document retention follows federal records management standards
- Fee calculations must be auditable and traceable
- Status changes trigger required notifications per 43 CFR regulations
