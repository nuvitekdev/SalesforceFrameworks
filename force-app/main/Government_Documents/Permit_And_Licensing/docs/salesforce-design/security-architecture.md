# Nuvi APD System - Security Architecture

## Overview

This document defines a comprehensive, multi-layered security architecture for the Nuvi APD system, supporting secure multi-agency collaboration while maintaining strict data segregation and audit compliance for federal operations.

## Security Design Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth
- **Multiple Security Layers**: Authentication → Authorization → Field-Level → Record-Level → Network
- **Zero Trust Model**: Verify every access request regardless of source
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary access rights
- **Need-to-Know Basis**: Data access limited to job requirements

### 2. Federal Compliance Standards
- **FedRAMP Moderate**: Cloud security framework compliance
- **FIPS 140-2**: Cryptographic module standards
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Risk management approach
- **FISMA**: Federal information system security
- **Section 508**: Accessibility requirements

### 3. Multi-Agency Coordination
- **Agency Segregation**: Secure data isolation between agencies
- **Cross-Agency Collaboration**: Controlled information sharing
- **Role-Based Access**: Agency-specific permission structures
- **Audit Transparency**: Complete access trail logging
