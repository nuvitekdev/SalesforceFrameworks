The 
primary 
measures 
of 
success 
are 
to: 
-
reduce 
permitting 
and 
authorizations 
time-todeliver 
(TTD), 
-
reduce 
economic 
impact 
of 
DOI 
permitting 
activities, 
-
enhance 
operational 
efficiency, 
-
streamline 
processes, 
and 
-
increase 
transparency 
in 
permitting 
activities
-
Authorization 
workflows. 
The 
system 
must 
be 
able 
to 
support 
complex 
authorization 
workflows 
and 
automations 
that 
include 
sequential 
and 
parallel 
reviews/steps. 
Examples 
of 
?authorizations? 
include 
Permitting, 
Licensing, 
Registrations, 
and 
Certifications. 
(Note: 
Workflows 
typically 
begin 
with 
an 
external 
applicant 
applying 
to 
perform 
some 
activity 
that 
is 
regulated 
either 
by 
rule 
or 
statute 
by 
the 
Department 
of 
Interior. 
Most 
workflows 
require 
fees 
and 
then 
move 
into 
a 
review 
process. 
The 
government 
is 
looking 
to 
optimize 
these 
review 
processes 
and 
greatly 
reduce 
the 
Time-To-Authorization/Delivery 
(TTD). 
-
Post-Authorization 
Monitoring, 
Governance, 
Reporting, 
Revocation, 
and 
Renewal 
workflows. 
-
AI 
optimization 
and 
support: 
The 
system 
must 
include 
the 
capability 
for 
applicant 
submissions 
to 
be 
immediately 
reviewed 
by 
AI 
to 
provide 
the 
applicant 
with 
actionable 
feedback 
prior 
to 
any 
final 
submissions.
 
Further, 
the 
system 
must 
provide 
subsequent 
workflow 
steps 
with 
AI 
review/summaries 
to 
support 
decreased 
Time-to-Delivery 
(TTD) 
of 
authorization 
tasks 
(reviews, 
approvals, 
collections). 
-
Solution 
must 
be 
able 
to 
detect 
and 
apply 
for 
any 
dependent 
authorizations 
without 
applicant 
needing 
to 
enter 
any 
data 
twice 
and 
without 
review 
cycles 
being 
unnecessarily 
impacted. 
Ideally, 
a 
multi-authorization 
workflow 
would 
kick 
off 
parallel 
authorization 
paths 
that 
delivered 
all 
necessary 
authorizations 
to 
the 
applicant 
without 
further 
unnecessary 
applicant 
interactions. 
-
Solution 
must 
be 
securely 
interoperable 
for 
authentication 
(oAuth, 
SASE/SAML, 
etc), 
payments 
(pay.gov), 
data 
exchange/interchange, 
and 
other 
interoperability 
requirements. 
-
Any 
proposed 
solution 
must 
include 
security 
documentation 
(FedRAMP 
for 
SaaS, 
ATO?s 
for 
others).
-
Solution 
must 
be 
capable 
of 
storing 
persistent 
data 
on 
core 
authorization 
entities/objects/tables. 
This 
includes 
People, 
Organizations, 
Locations, 
Activity 
being 
Authorized, 
Files/Documents/Media, 
Relevant 
Regulations/Laws, 
Violations, 
and 
Transactional 
Ledger(s) 
-
Solution

able 
to

Website 
using 
that 
site?s 
look 
and 
feel, 
domain 
(e.g. 
headless 
systems, 
proxy 
with 
stylesheets, 
node), 
and 
be 
transparent 
to 
the 
end 
user. 
-
Reports 
and 
dashboards 
must 
be 
included 
on 
state/status, 
time 
to 
delivery, 
optimization/bottleneck 
highlights/opportunities, 
and 
other 
key 
KPIs 
for 
authorization 
workflows 
-
Solution 
must 
be 
based 
on 
modern 
technology 
stack 
that 
will 
be 
market-relevant 
for 
a 
minimum 
of 
12 
years
-
