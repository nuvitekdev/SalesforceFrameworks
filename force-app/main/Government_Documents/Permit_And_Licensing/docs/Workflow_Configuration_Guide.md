# Workflows Module

## Overview

Complex workflow management system for Nuvi permit review processes. Orchestrates multi-agency reviews, approval chains, SLA tracking, and escalation procedures across sequential and parallel review stages.

## Purpose

Manages the complete review lifecycle including:
- Multi-stage approval workflows
- Parallel and sequential review processes
- SLA tracking with automated escalations
- Task assignment and routing
- Review coordination across agencies
- Decision tracking and audit trails

- `DOI_PAL_Legal_Review_Process` - SOL legal review
- `DOI_PAL_Multi_Agency_Coordination` - Inter-agency workflow

## Workflow Types

### 1. APD Review Workflow
**Stages**: Technical → Environmental → Legal → Final Approval
- **Technical Review** (BLM): 15 business days
- **Environmental Review** (NEPA): 30 business days
- **Legal Review** (SOL): 10 business days
- **Final Approval** (BLM): 5 business days

### 2. Environmental Assessment Workflow
**Parallel Process**: Impact Analysis + Consultation + Public Comment
- **Impact Analysis**: Environmental specialists review
- **Tribal Consultation**: BIA coordination required
- **Public Comment**: 30-day comment period
- **Compliance Review**: Final environmental clearance

### 3. Mining Permit Workflow
**Sequential with Checkpoints**: Plan Review → Environmental → Bonding → Approval
- **Mining Plan Review**: Technical feasibility assessment
- **Environmental Impact**: Enhanced environmental review
- **Bonding Verification**: Financial assurance validation
- **Final Authorization**: Multi-signature approval

### 4. Expedited Review Workflow
**Fast-Track Process**: For low-impact applications
- **Initial Screening**: Automated eligibility check
- **Streamlined Review**: Single-stage review
- **Rapid Approval**: 5-10 business day turnaround

## Review Role Matrix

| Review Stage | BLM Staff | NPS Staff | BIA Staff | SOL Staff | External |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Technical Review | Primary | Advisory | N/A | N/A | Consultants |
| Environmental | Advisory | Primary | Consultation | N/A | EPA/State |
| Cultural Resources | N/A | Advisory | Primary | N/A | SHPO |
| Legal Review | N/A | N/A | N/A | Primary | N/A |
| Final Approval | Primary | Sign-off | Sign-off | Sign-off | N/A |

## SLA Standards

### Standard Processing Times
- **APD Applications**: 60 calendar days
- **General Permits**: 30 calendar days
- **Mining Permits**: 90 calendar days
- **Recreation Permits**: 45 calendar days

### Escalation Triggers
- **Warning Level**: 75% of SLA time elapsed
- **Escalation Level 1**: SLA exceeded by 25%
- **Escalation Level 2**: SLA exceeded by 50%
- **Emergency Escalation**: Critical issues or executive requests

## Best Practices

### Workflow Design
- Design for parallel processing where possible
- Implement clear decision points and criteria
- Maintain audit trail for all workflow actions
- Enable workflow rollback for corrections

### Task Management
- Auto-assign based on workload balancing
- Provide clear task descriptions and requirements
- Include estimated completion times
- Enable task delegation and substitution

### Performance Optimization
- Use batch processing for bulk workflow operations
- Implement queueable jobs for long-running processes
- Cache frequently accessed workflow configurations
- Optimize notification delivery

## Integration Points

- **Applications Module**: Workflow initiation and status updates
- **Users Module**: Role-based task assignments
- **Notifications Module**: Automated alerts and reminders
- **Documents Module**: Review document access
- **AI Services Module**: Automated review assistance
- **Scheduling Module**: Review meeting coordination

## Configuration Examples

### Creating Workflow Template
```apex
DOI_PAL_Workflow_Template__c apdWorkflow = new DOI_PAL_Workflow_Template__c(
    Name = 'APD Standard Review',
    Application_Type__c = 'APD',
    Total_SLA_Days__c = 60,
    Parallel_Processing__c = false
);
```

### Stage Configuration
```apex
DOI_PAL_Workflow_Stage__c technicalReview = new DOI_PAL_Workflow_Stage__c(
    Stage_Name__c = 'Technical Review',
    Assigned_Role__c = 'BLM Technical Reviewer',
    SLA_Days__c = 15,
    Stage_Order__c = 1,
    Required_Completion__c = true
);
```

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Key Metrics
