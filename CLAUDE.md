## AI-Powered Development Workflow

### Gemini CLI Integration

**ALWAYS use Gemini CLI for complex analysis before implementation:**

1. **Code Analysis**: Break down complex code structures
   ```bash
   echo "analyze the structure and dependencies of [component/class]" | gemini
   ```

2. **Architecture Decisions**: Evaluate design patterns
   ```bash
   echo "compare trigger framework vs process builder for [use case]" | gemini
   ```

3. **Performance Analysis**: Identify bottlenecks
   ```bash
   echo "analyze governor limit risks in [code section]" | gemini
   ```

4. **Security Review**: Validate security implementations
   ```bash
   echo "review security vulnerabilities in [component]" | gemini
   ```

### Agent Selection Strategy

**Use specialized agents based on task complexity:**

1. **repository-organizer**: Initial project setup and structure cleanup
2. **salesforce-architect**: Design Salesforce solutions and data models
3. **salesforce-automation-builder**: Implement Apex triggers and automation
4. **salesforce-object-builder**: Create custom objects and fields
5. **salesforce-permission-builder**: Configure security and permissions
6. **security-role-analyzer**: Analyze and map security requirements
7. **mcp-integration-specialist**: Validate against current best practices
8. **lwc-ui-designer**: Design Lightning Web Components
9. **documentation-generator**: Create comprehensive documentation
10. **salesforce-ui-builder**: Implement Salesforce UI components

### Decision Flow

```
1. Receive Task
   ↓
2. Use Gemini CLI to analyze complexity
   ↓
3. If complex multi-step task:
   → Deploy appropriate specialized agent
   → Agent uses Gemini for sub-analysis
   → Agent returns structured solution
   ↓
4. Implement solution with production standards
   ↓
5. Validate with lint, tests, and security checks
```

## Always Follow These Best Practices

### 1. Code Quality Checks

**MANDATORY**: After ANY code changes, run:

```bash
npm run lint && npm run prettier:verify
```

If these commands fail, fix the issues before considering the task complete.

**Auto-fix formatting issues**:

```bash
npm run prettier
```

### 2. Salesforce-Specific Practices

- Always follow Salesforce naming conventions (e.g., `__c` for custom fields)
- Use proper error handling with try-catch blocks in Apex
- Follow bulkification patterns for triggers and batch operations
- Respect governor limits in all Apex code
- Use @AuraEnabled(cacheable=true) for read-only LWC wire methods

### 3. Testing Requirements

- All Apex classes must have corresponding test classes with >75% coverage
- LWC components should have Jest tests
- Run tests before marking any task complete:
  ```bash
  npm run test:unit
  ```

### 4. Security Best Practices

- Never expose sensitive data in console.logs or debug statements
- Always use WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED in SOQL queries
- Validate all user inputs
- Use proper field-level security checks
- Never hardcode credentials or API keys

### 5. Architecture Patterns

- Maintain modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Use shared components in the appropriate shared directories
- Follow the existing domain-based structure (Document_Routing, Ethics_Compliance, etc.)
- Reuse utility components from UtilityComponents directory

### 6. Git Workflow

- Always check git status before making changes
- Create meaningful commit messages following this pattern:
  ```
  feat: add new feature
  fix: resolve bug in component
  refactor: improve code structure
  test: add/update tests
  docs: update documentation
  ```
- Never commit without running lint and tests first

### 7. Enhanced Development Workflow

1. **Initial Analysis Phase**:
   ```bash
   echo "analyze complexity of [task description]" | gemini
   ```
   - Determine if specialized agent is needed
   - Identify potential governor limit issues
   - Review security implications

2. **Agent Deployment (if needed)**:
   - For repository cleanup: Use `repository-organizer` agent
   - For Salesforce architecture: Use `salesforce-architect` agent
   - For automation: Use `salesforce-automation-builder` agent
   - For UI/UX: Use `lwc-ui-designer` or `salesforce-ui-builder` agents

3. **Detailed Planning**:
   ```bash
   echo "create implementation plan for [specific feature]" | gemini
   ```

4. **Implementation**:
   - Follow Gemini's architectural recommendations
   - Apply agent-provided patterns
   - Maintain production standards

5. **Validation**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint && npm run prettier:verify && npm run test:unit
   ```

6. **Security Check**:
   ```bash
   echo "review security of [implemented feature]" | gemini
   ```

7. **Documentation**:
   - Use `documentation-generator` agent for comprehensive docs
   - Update README files in each component folder

8. **Commit with proper message**

### 8. Code Style

- Use consistent indentation (check existing files)
- Follow existing naming conventions in the project
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable names

### 9. Performance Considerations

- Lazy load components when possible
- Use pagination for large data sets
- Optimize SOQL queries (selective filters, indexed fields)
- Cache frequently accessed data appropriately

### 10. Documentation

- Update relevant documentation when adding new features
- Document any new APIs or complex logic
- Keep inline comments minimal but meaningful

## Automatic Excellence Rules

### Tech Lead Behaviors

1. **Proactive Architecture**: Always consider scalability, performance, and maintainability
2. **Code Reviews**: Mentally review your own code as if reviewing a junior's PR
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify and implement design patterns that elevate the codebase
4. **Performance First**: Consider governor limits, query optimization, and caching in every solution
5. **Security by Default**: Implement FLS, CRUD, and sharing rules without being asked
