# Nuvitek Salesforce Frameworks - Architecture Overview

## Executive Summary

The Nuvitek Salesforce Frameworks represents a comprehensive, domain-driven architecture designed specifically for government and public sector organizations. This enterprise-grade solution provides 7 distinct business domain applications and 15+ reusable utility components, all built following Salesforce best practices and modern architectural patterns.

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

The codebase is organized around business domains rather than technical concerns, enabling:

- Clear separation of business logic
- Independent development and deployment cycles
- Easier maintenance and understanding
- Scalable team structures aligned with business areas

### 2. Component-Based Architecture

- **Utility Components**: 15+ reusable LWC components with Apex controllers
- **Domain-Specific Components**: Business-focused components within each domain
- **Shared Resources**: Common metadata and configurations in `Home/` directory

### 3. Government Compliance by Design

- Field-level security enforcement
- Audit trail capabilities
- 508 Compliance considerations
- Data retention and privacy controls

## Repository Structure

```
force-app/main/
├── Document_Routing/          # Document workflow and routing
├── Ethics_Compliance/         # Ethics and compliance management
├── Government_Documents/       # Government document processing
├── HR_Administrative/         # HR processes and workflows
├── Home/                     # Shared platform components
├── Inventory/                # Asset and inventory management

├── Travel/                   # Travel management processes
└── UtilityComponents/        # Cross-domain reusable components
```

## Domain Architecture

Each business domain follows a standardized structure:

### Domain Structure Pattern

```
DomainName/
├── README.md                 # Domain overview and documentation
├── SubDomain1/              # Business subdomain
│   └── README.md
├── SubDomain2/              # Business subdomain
│   └── README.md
└── shared/                  # Domain-specific shared components
    ├── applications/        # Salesforce App definitions
    ├── classes/            # Apex classes and controllers
    ├── flexipages/         # Lightning page layouts
    ├── flows/              # Process Builder & Flow definitions
    ├── layouts/            # Page layouts
    ├── lwc/                # Lightning Web Components
    ├── objects/            # Custom objects and fields
    ├── permissionsets/     # Access control definitions
    ├── profiles/           # User profiles
    ├── staticresources/    # Static files and resources
    ├── tabs/               # Custom tabs
    └── triggers/           # Apex triggers
```

### Shared vs Domain-Specific Resources

**Domain Shared (`/shared/`)**: Components used across subdomains within the same business area
**Utility Components (`/UtilityComponents/`)**: Cross-domain reusable components
**Home (`/Home/`)**: Platform-wide shared resources (profiles, networks, etc.)

## Component Architecture

### Utility Components Design Pattern

Each utility component follows this standardized architecture:

```
ComponentName/
├── README.md                # Comprehensive component documentation
├── classes/                 # Apex backend logic
│   ├── ComponentController.cls
│   ├── ComponentController.cls-meta.xml
│   ├── ComponentControllerTest.cls
│   └── ComponentControllerTest.cls-meta.xml
├── lwc/                    # Lightning Web Components
│   ├── jsconfig.json
│   └── componentName/
│       ├── componentName.html
│       ├── componentName.js
│       ├── componentName.js-meta.xml
│       ├── componentName.css
│       └── __tests__/      # Jest unit tests
├── objects/                # Custom objects and metadata
├── staticresources/       # External libraries and assets
├── permissionsets/       # Component-specific permissions
└── customMetadata/       # Configuration metadata types
```
